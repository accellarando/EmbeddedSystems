* Ryan Lam
* Matt Alter

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a controllable robot that can navigate an obstacle course without running into any objects.

## Basic Setup
1. Print the chassis linked in the Bill of Materials at 80%, or similar. If using the linked chassis, also print the motor holder.
2. Mount the battery pack behind the motor holders, this will hang over the back edge of the robot.
3. Using a breadboard on the front, mount the two ultrasonic sensors on the left and right sides of the breadboard, and the bluetooth adaptor in the center.
4. Connect the battery pack to one set of power and ground rails, and use a voltage divider to connect the other rail.
5. Wire the components as shown in the Documentation.
6.
